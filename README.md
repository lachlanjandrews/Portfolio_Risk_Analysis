# Portfolio Risk Analysis
**Module 4 Challenge**

This challenge we take a look at leading hedge funds and investors and how their portfolios track compared to the S&P TSX 60. Using tools like standard deviation, sharpe ratio, beta score and the covariance, we were able to track how risky portfolios were and how their returns might be. We were also tasked with creating our own portfolio and seeing how it tracked compared to the others. Mine did really well and almost had better growth than the S&P TSX 60.
